Things to be cached:
    - Attraction IDs
    - Venue IDs
    - Event IDs
    - Classification IDs
    - Segments IDs
    - Search Keywords
    - ViewFromMySeat pictures
    
Implementing Cache: Instead of making so many API calls, try to diminish by caching user search results 
                    and pictures from available seats in a specific venue
